# Summer 2022 Intern VR Project

## Setting up Oculus
Power on your Quest and plug it into your computer using Oculus Link. 
Put on the headset and Oculus should walk you through the setup process, 
including setting the floor height and drawing a guardian barrier.
When you have reached the home screen, please press on the account/battery button
and select "Oculus Link" to enter the white Oculus Link landing page.

Now set your Oculus aside and begin computer setup.

## Installation Instructions
In order to run this project, first download Epic Games Launcher.

Navigate to Unreal Engine -> Library and Install Unreal Engine 4.27.
Then Launch the Engine, and use the browse button to find this directory. Select VRBlockOut.uproject.

Once the project is opened, in the dropdown of the play menu, select "VR Preview". 
If this button is grayed out, it may be necessary to put on your headset, ensure Oculus Link is set up,
(it should be a white landscape), and relaunch Unreal Engine.
